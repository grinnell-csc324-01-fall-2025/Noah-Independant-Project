Minigame: Find the exit
Traverse your way through a grid to reach the exit, however the exit of the grid changes every time you move. Find the pattern/gimmick of the exit and predict how to move to where it will be next turn.
This will teach me the basics of the game engine my team is planning to use for the final project, but it will also teach me the process of game design. 
In the future, this minigame will be implemented into our larger game, which will be a story driven minigame experience, where you explore a computer to learn the story of the previous user.

Tools:
I will be coding the project in lua using love2d. The art, if I even get to that, will also be done by me in photoshop or asperite. I will not be using AI of anysort for this project.
