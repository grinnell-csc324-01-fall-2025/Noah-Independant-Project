What did you like about the game and why?
I liked the sound a lot, and I thought that the characters were silly and fun. The game mechanics are super interesting and the first few levels did a good job at introducing me to movement. The cut reminded me of a more interesting version of Pac-Man.

What would you change and why?
I think the level progression was tough for someone playing for the first time. I was confused on the controls at first and it took me a while to see the hints in the bottom ran up and difficulty a little too hard near the middle. The dying sounds got old after a while.

Do you think this game would be better with more players?
I think adding more players would be interesting for the level design. But I already had a lot going on at the screen at once so I think that if you were to do more characters, you have to make it later in the game so the people or players have a better understanding of the controls
